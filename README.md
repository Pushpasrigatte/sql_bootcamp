Simple definition of data.

Data is a collection of facts, numbers, words, or measurements that can be recorded and used for analysis or decision-making.

Examples:

* A person's name, age, or phone number
* Temperature readings over a week
* Answers in a survey

In short: Data is raw information.


A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Example:

Think of a database like a digital filing cabinet where information such as names, phone numbers, and addresses are stored in a structured way, so you can quickly find or update anything when needed.

Real-life Examples:

 Your phone contacts (names, numbers)
 A student record system in a college
 A bank system storing customer transactions



Understanding Databases & MySQL

- What is a database?
    - Real-life analogy: Library storing books with an index system
    - Why structured data is important
- Introduction to MySQL
    - What is MySQL and where is it used?
    - MySQL vs other databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Installing MySQL & Setting Up the Environment
    - How to install MySQL on Windows/Mac/Linux
    - Using MySQL Workbench or command line
    - Creating the first database

Basic SQL Operations

- Understanding SQL Syntax
    - SQL as a structured way to communicate with databases
    - Capitalization, indentation, and best practices
  

- Creating & Using a Database
    - CREATE DATABASE library_db; (Real-life example: Library system)
    - USE library_db;
      
- Creating Tables & Defining Schema
  - Understanding columns & data types
  - CREATE TABLE books (id INT, title VARCHAR(100), author VARCHAR(100), year INT);
  - Primary keys and unique constraints
- Inserting Data into Tables
    - `INSERT INTO books VALUES (1, "Harry Potter", "J.K. Rowling", 1997);`
    - Adding multiple rows
    - Real-life analogy: Registering books in a library system
- Retrieving Data with SELECT
    - `SELECT * FROM books;` (Fetching all data)
    - Selecting specific columns (`SELECT title, author FROM books;`)
    - Using WHERE for filtering (`SELECT * FROM books WHERE author="J.K. Rowling";`)
- Practical Exercise
    - Create a Student Database
    - Insert 5 students with name, age, and course
    - Retrieve all students and filter by course

Day 2: Advanced Queries and Data Manipulation
Objective: Learn how to update, delete, filter, sort, and join data using SQL.

1. Modifying Data in Tables

   a. Updating Records (UPDATE statement)
   Example:
   UPDATE books SET year = 2000 WHERE title = 'Harry Potter';
   Real-life analogy: Updating a product’s price in an online store.

   b. Deleting Records (DELETE statement)
   Example:
   DELETE FROM books WHERE year < 2000;
   Real-life analogy: Removing expired products from an inventory.

2. Filtering and Sorting Data

   a. Using AND and OR in conditions
   Example:
   SELECT \* FROM books WHERE author = 'J.K. Rowling' AND year > 1995;
   Real-life analogy: Searching for books by a specific author written after a certain year.

   b. Sorting Results with ORDER BY
   Alphabetical order:
   SELECT \* FROM books ORDER BY title ASC;
   Year-wise (latest first):
   SELECT \* FROM books ORDER BY year DESC;
   Real-life analogy: Sorting items in an app by name or by latest date.

   c. Limiting Data with LIMIT
   Example:
   SELECT \* FROM books LIMIT 3;
   Real-life analogy: Showing the top 3 recent news articles on a website.

3. Joining Multiple Tables

   a. Why do we need relationships between tables?
   Example: A student can enroll in multiple courses.
   Real-life analogy: One author can write multiple books.

   b. Creating a second table (authors)
   CREATE TABLE authors (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(100)
   );

   c. Linking authors to books using a foreign key
   CREATE TABLE books (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(100),
   year INT,
   author\_id INT,
   FOREIGN KEY (author\_id) REFERENCES authors(id)
   );

   d. Using INNER JOIN to combine tables
   Example:
   SELECT books.title, authors.name
   FROM books
   INNER JOIN authors ON books.author\_id = authors.id;
   Real-life analogy: Fetching customer orders with product details.

Summary:

* Learned how to modify data using UPDATE and DELETE
* Filtered and sorted data using WHERE, AND, OR, ORDER BY, and LIMIT
* Created relational tables and used INNER JOIN to combine data from multiple tables




Day 3: Functions, Transactions and Real-World Use Cases
Objective: Learn MySQL functions, transactions, and apply knowledge to real-world scenarios.

1. Using MySQL Functions

   a. String Functions
   Examples: UPPER(), LOWER(), CONCAT()
   Use Case: Formatting student names in uppercase for display or reporting

   b. Numeric Functions
   Examples: AVG(), SUM(), COUNT()
   Use Case: Calculating the total number of students enrolled in a course

   c. Date Functions
   Examples: NOW(), DATE\_FORMAT()
   Use Case: Displaying order history with human-readable dates

2. Grouping and Aggregating Data

   a. GROUP BY for summaries
   Example query:
   SELECT course, COUNT(\*) FROM students GROUP BY course;
   Real-life analogy: Counting the number of students enrolled in each course

   b. HAVING for advanced filtering
   Example query:
   SELECT course, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY course HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
   Use Case: Displaying only the courses with more than 10 students

3. Understanding Transactions

   a. What is a transaction in MySQL?
   A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work
   Real-life analogy: A bank transfer where money is deducted from one account and added to another

   b. Commands used in transactions
   START TRANSACTION — to begin the transaction
   COMMIT — to save the changes permanently
   ROLLBACK — to undo changes if an error occurs
   Example: Transferring balance between two accounts ensuring data consistency

4. Real-World Application: E-commerce Database

   a. Tables involved in an online store
   customers — stores customer information
   products — stores product details
   orders — stores order information and links customers with products

   b. Example queries

   * Retrieve all orders placed by a customer:
     SELECT \* FROM orders WHERE customer\_id = 101;

   * Show top-selling products:
     SELECT product\_id, COUNT(\*) AS total\_sales
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY product\_id
     ORDER BY total\_sales DESC;

   * Find customers who have not made a purchase:
     SELECT \* FROM customers
     WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customer\_id FROM orders);
